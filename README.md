### What I Learned
This project was a great way to get introduced to basic CSS styling and editing using a visual reference. I was able to become comfortable with estimating the margins and paddings of various elements. This along with proper positioning helped me create a clone of the Google Homepage. I also learned how important structuring with div tags are, as well as how common it is in modern day websites.
